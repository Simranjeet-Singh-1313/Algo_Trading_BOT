# Algo_Trading_BOT
In this project we created an Algo-trading Bot in which I have applied two strategies first one was simple moving average and the second one was higher high and lower low. 
If both strategies happen simultaneously then we enter any stock and first entry of any stock with the total quantity of 50 after that every entry of quantity 100.
First 50 quantities to cancelled previous position and next 50 quantity to make new position in opposite direction. by using interactive API I have generate  dataset. 
The Algo-trading code has been run for generating two different datasets first one was one minute chart for two weeks and second one is five minutes chart also run for two weeks. 
Thereafter we have proceeded with hypothesis testing. In hypothesis testing we have applied ANOVA test two times first test on one minute chart and second test on five minutes chart and later T test is applied between one minute chart and five minutes chart. 
The overall result of one minute chart was in loss of $38474.36. on the other hand, the loss of five minutes chart is much lesser than the loss of one minute chart that was $ 2872.42.
